      We want you to be satisfied with DriveGuard Pro. Please read this policy carefully to
      understand your refund options before making a purchase.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All purchases of DriveGuard Pro are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong> (paddle.com), our
      authorised reseller and Merchant of Record. Refunds are issued through Paddle back to your
      original payment method.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Standalone (Perpetual) License Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Standalone licenses are one-time purchases. The following conditions apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Refund requests submitted within <strong>14 days of the original purchase date</strong>
        will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refunds are <strong>not issued</strong> once a license key has been activated on a machine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refunds are <strong>not issued</strong> for change-of-mind requests after the 14-day window.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the Software fails to function as described and the issue cannot be resolved by our
        support team, a refund may be granted at our discretion regardless of activation status.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscription Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      DriveGuard Pro subscriptions (monthly or annual) are billed on a recurring basis through Paddle.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cancellations:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time via the Paddle
        customer portal. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period and no
        further charges will be made.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Partial refunds:</strong> We do not issue partial refunds for unused time in a billing
        period after cancellation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Annual subscriptions:</strong> Refund requests for annual plans submitted within
        14 days of the initial purchase or renewal date will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
        provided the Software has not been actively used during that period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Duplicate charges:</strong> If you were charged more than once due to a billing
        error, contact us immediately and we will arrange a full refund of the duplicate charge.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
    <p>Refunds will not be issued in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>License keys that have been activated and used.</li>
      <li>Refund requests made after the 14-day window for standalone purchases.</li>
      <li>Subscription periods already consumed prior to cancellation.</li>
      <li>Purchases made through unauthorised third-party resellers.</li>
      <li>Accounts suspended or terminated due to violation of our Terms and Conditions.</li>
    </ul>
