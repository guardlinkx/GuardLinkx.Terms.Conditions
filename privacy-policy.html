    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account &amp; Purchase Information:</strong> Your name and email address collected
        at the time of purchase, processed and stored by our payment partner Paddle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>License Information:</strong> A unique license key tied to your purchase, used to
        activate and validate the Software on your machine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Backup Data:</strong> Files you choose to back up via the cloud backup feature.
        This data is stored encrypted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and is accessible only to you.
        We do not access or read your backup data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Information:</strong> A hardware identifier used solely to enforce single-machine
        activation limits. This identifier is not shared with third parties.

        <strong>Support Communications:</strong> Any information you voluntarily provide when contacting
        our support team by email.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver, activate, and validate your license.</li>
      <li>Provide cloud backup services to subscription users.</li>
      <li>Process payments and manage billing through Paddle.</li>

      <li>Send important product notices (e.g., license expiry, material policy updates).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for advertising or sell it to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We work with a limited number of trusted third parties to operate our services:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Paddle (paddle.com):</strong> Our authorised reseller and Merchant of Record.
        Paddle handles all payment processing and stores your billing information under their
        <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> Cloud infrastructure used to store encrypted
        backup data for subscription users. AWS operates under its own
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Notice</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not share your personal information with any other third parties except as required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take security seriously and apply the following measures to protect your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All backup data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using AES-256 on AWS.</li>
      <li>Each user's backup data is isolated under a unique, scoped access key.</li>
      <li>Access to production systems is restricted to authorised personnel only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While we employ industry-standard safeguards, no system is 100% secure. We encourage you to
      keep your license key and account credentials confidential.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide our services or as
      required by law:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>License &amp; account data:</strong> Retained for the duration of your license plus
        a reasonable period for billing and legal compliance (typically 7 years).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud backup data:</strong> Retained while your subscription is active. Upon
        subscription cancellation or expiry, your backup data may be deleted after a 30-day grace
        period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support communications:</strong> Retained for up to 2 years after the last
        correspondence.
      </li>
    </ul>
