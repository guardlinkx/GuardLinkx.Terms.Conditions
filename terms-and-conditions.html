    <div class="highlight">
      Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before purchasing or using DriveGuard Pro.
      By installing or activating the software you agree to be bound by these terms.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User",
      "you") and GuardLinkx ("Company", "we", "us") governing your use of DriveGuard Pro (the
      "Software"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not install or use the Software.
    </p>

    <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms and timely payment of applicable fees, we grant
    you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install and run the Software on the number of machines permitted by your license tier.</li>
      <li>Use the Software solely for your own personal or internal business purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may not sublicense, sell, resell, transfer, assign, or otherwise commercially exploit the
    Software.</p>

    <h2>3. License Tiers</h2>
    <p>DriveGuard Pro is offered under two license tiers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Standalone (Perpetual):</strong> A one-time purchase granting a perpetual license to
        use the version purchased. Standalone licenses do not include cloud backup features and do not
        expire. Limited to one machine activation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription:</strong> A recurring subscription (monthly or annual) granting access
        to all features including cloud backup. The subscription remains active as long as payments
        are current. Limited to one machine activation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. License Key and Activation</h2>
    <p>
      Upon purchase, a unique license key is generated and delivered to your registered email address.
      You are responsible for keeping your license key confidential. Each license key may be activated
      on one machine at a time. You may deactivate your license and transfer it to a new machine via
      the Settings panel in the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to deactivate license keys that are found to be shared, resold, or used in
      violation of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments and Billing</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong> (paddle.com), our authorised reseller and
      Merchant of Record. By completing a purchase you also agree to Paddle's terms of service and
      privacy policy. All prices are shown in USD unless otherwise stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscription fees are billed automatically on a recurring basis (monthly or annual) until
      cancelled. You authorise us (via Paddle) to charge your payment method on each renewal date.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time from your Paddle
      customer portal. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period; no partial
      refunds are issued for unused time. After cancellation, cloud backup features are disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Standalone purchases:</strong> Refund requests made within 14 days of purchase will be
      reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Refunds are not issued after a license key has been activated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To request a refund contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@guardlinkx.com">support@guardlinkx.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Cloud Backup Service</h2>
    <p>
      Subscription users have access to the DriveGuard Pro cloud backup feature, which stores
      encrypted backup data in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 storage. The following apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud backup requires an active Subscription license and an internet connection.</li>
      <li>
        Your backup data is stored under a unique prefix derived from your license key. Only you can
        access your data via the scoped credentials issued by our service.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not access, read, or share your backup data. Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at
        rest (AES-256) on AWS infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>
        We reserve the right to impose storage limits on individual accounts. We will notify you
        before enforcing any new limits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud backup availability is subject to AWS uptime. We are not liable for temporary service
        interruptions caused by third-party infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.</li>
      <li>Use the Software to back up data you do not own or have rights to.</li>
      <li>Use the Software in any manner that violates applicable local, national, or international law.</li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent license validation or activation mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Share, resell, or distribute your license key to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The Software and all associated intellectual property rights are and shall remain the exclusive
      property of GuardLinkx. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or
      branding.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Updates and Support</h2>
    <p>
      We may release updates to the Software from time to time. Subscription users receive updates
      for the duration of their active subscription. Standalone users receive updates for the major
      version purchased. We are under no obligation to provide support beyond what is described here.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
      BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
      NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING ADEQUATE BACKUPS OF YOUR DATA. THE SOFTWARE IS A
      SUPPLEMENTARY BACKUP TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS YOUR ONLY MEANS OF DATA PROTECTION.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GUARDLINKX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
      TO LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
      OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE IN
      THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      We collect minimal personal data necessary to deliver the Software and its services (name,
      email address, and payment information handled by Paddle). We do not sell your personal data
      to third parties. For full details please refer to our Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your license immediately, without notice, if you breach these Terms.
      Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and delete all copies in your possession.
      Sections 9, 11, 12, and 15 survive termination.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction
      in which GuardLinkx is registered, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

    <p>
      We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated
      via email or a notice within the Software. Continued use of the Software after changes take
      effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
